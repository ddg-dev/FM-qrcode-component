## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- NodeJS
- [NPM Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcodejs) - QRCode.js

### What I learned

I used NodeJS and the NPM Library QRCode.js for generating a QRCode from an URL.
I did the same design for the Desktop and Mobile versions by using Flexbox.

### Continued development

For my next projects, this NPM Library [NPM Library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qrcodejs) - QRCode.js will help me a lot.
Next times I will let the user make his QRCode by typing an URL or a text or an image, perhaps ?
